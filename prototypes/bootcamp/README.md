# Bootcamp Prototype

This bootcamp prototypes a C# ASP.NET Project with a React Client app
working together. This bootcamp was used in the meeting on Sept. 25th
to give the team a tutorial on using the GitFlow workflow.

## Objective

This prototype is mainly used as a proof of concept so the team can
get familiar with both technologies. This example code is provided by
Microsoft.

## Result

The project was successfully used to show team members how to use Git,
and to set up their development environments at the meeting on Sept. 25th.
