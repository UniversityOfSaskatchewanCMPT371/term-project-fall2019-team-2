## After Action Report (Minutes)

> Duration: ~1 hour

0. ID2 Mini-Post-Mortem
  - What part of the process failed?
    - We were optimistic with our Gantt schedule (considering midterm season)
    - PM needs to do more check-ins with the leads
    - We proritized individual features rather than functionality
    - Unit tests were not written for code on the repo
    - Little pair programming was done
  - Solutions
    - Be less optimistic about schedule (although this may be a lot easier now that midterms are over)
    - PM does formal check-ins with leads once every two days
    - Prioritize features based on functionality
    - Do not accept code without unit tests to dev
    - Quota of 2 pair programming sessions per ID is madatory
    
  - What part of the process was good?
    - The development party on saturday was really good, both for team-building and productivity
      - We will do this regularily from now on
  
  - What were the major blockages for people producing good work?
    - Some wrong work was done, this was a result of the design document not being fully fleshed out
    - Some work was hampered by technical issues, this should be addressed by mandatory minimum pair-programming
