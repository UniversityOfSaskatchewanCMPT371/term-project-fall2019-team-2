Builds in this deliverable changed to automatically create our electron builds on MacOS, Linux and Windows
completely automatically whenever we create a new tagged release for this repository. The tagged release will
automatically have build artifacts in the following formats attached to it:

- .snap file type for Linux amd64
- .AppImage file type for Linux amd64
- .exe setup file for Windows amd64
- .dmg setup file for MacOS

In order to create the builds on all the platforms we use a docker image with wine on Linux and run the build
natively on MacOS for the Mac builds.

For viewing our current code climate and test coverage, refer to sonarcloud [here](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=cmpt371-team2) which is updated on every push to the repository.
