Team Policy 

Attendance

Meetings and class room attendance is considered mandatory. 
If an individual cannot attend a meeting they are to notify the project lead (Amanda Zimolag) ahead of time and read the meeting minutes after. If more than three meetings are missed in the course of the term that person must talk to Amanda, if any more meetings are missed the team will talk to Dr. Osgood.

Ten minute meetings before class will be used as an informal stand up.
If a team 2 member cannot attend they are to post on slack what they have done since last time and what they plan to do for next time. 

All members will pull from the repo and check slack daily. We will not push code that is known to be broken. 

In cases of disagreements the project lead (Amanda) executive desion making power. All code must be reviewed by another team member before it is merged. We all commit to creating a safe work place where every opinion is valued and listened to. If team members are having disagreements that are effecting the project these will be brought to the project manager and if necessary Dr. Osgood.
