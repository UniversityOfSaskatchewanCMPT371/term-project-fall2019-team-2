1. Nicely structured top-level readme file, MUCH appreciate the links -- well organized
2. Very solid mini-milestone list
3. Nice planning document -- impressive the care that went into planning out needs
4. Very pleased with requirements document
5. Good work to include testability
6. Risk documentation is good, make sure everyone is on the same page
7. Happy to see test cases being formulated for at least certain requirements.  Nicely done, and I look forward to seeing the expansion
8. Log of time:  There are inconsistencies in recording estimated hours, and in the level of data
9. Meeting documents are good, although first is labeled as a teleconference when it was in fact an in-person meeting, if I recall
10. Glad to see the review that took place, but would strongly encourage to have additionally formal inspections (pre-circulation of review package, timing, different roles, list of items to be addressed, confirming that items were addressed later).  
11. Great to see active use of issues
12. Would be nice if some single document or place provided  at least high-level description of the spike prototypes (right now, need to navigate repo readme.md)
13. Pleased that adhering to TDD.  Think about putting in place Software contracts together with the TDD, as they can help inform design of tests.
14. Will be important to finish setup of CI and capacity to run a smoke test/suite of tests in the build
15. Would be good to have at least a small (2 page) design document on division of responsibilities in the design or architecture -- Might there be such a document available right now?  I ask in part because I thought that it had been mentioned as anticipated  

Beyond this feedback directly from Osgood, it's worth noting that we will be going forward with weekly builds from now on.
These will be reviewed on Saturdays at 4:00pm starting on October 26th.
