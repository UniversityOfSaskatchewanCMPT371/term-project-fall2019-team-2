# ID2 Review


1. There was mention of Electron in a stakeholder meeting, this didn't make it's way into the requirements document. This is fine for ID2, but should probably make it's way into the requirements in ID3.

2. Watch out for boilerplate stuff in documents.  Some templates were copied over and contained old dates. 

3. Risk documentation should include not just new risks, but a comparison with the old risk document, and how those risk have been either averted, are still on the horizon.

4. Testing documents:
  - Thoughtful, well put together
  - There needs to be more concrete information in these tests, what is the input, what is the expected output

5. Improvements with CI are really good, one of the strongest parts of ID2

6. Design documents:
  - Missing pre-condition/post-conditions
    - These should help the test team, and help the dev team (in writing assert statements)

7. There are no tests on dev.  What has been written does not currently have any associated tests with it on dev.

Very Important take-away:
  - For future IDs, code will be considered *incomplete* if it isn't accompanied by tests, and we will not be graded or assessed on any code lacking testing.
