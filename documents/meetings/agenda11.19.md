# Meeting Agenda (NOV 19TH, 2019)

ID3 Retrospective and Moving Forward


1. ID4 Post-Mortem
  - What was done right?
  - What was done wrong?
    - How can we improve those things?
  
2. ID4 Mini Milestones
  - What can we expect to accomplish, what do we want to prioritize?
    - Maybe an early feature freeze and focus on bug-fixes?
    - Maybe focus more on polish/aesthetics?
  - Pick a formal inspection item
    - Who still hasn't been inspected?
    - Who still hasn't done an inspection?
  - We should inspect design docs this deliverable
    - Make sure they're as-built before going into the last ID
  - We should probably inspect the requirements documents as well
