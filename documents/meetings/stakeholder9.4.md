## Stakeholder Meeting Minutes

1. Scrolling should be done with arrow keys, the dragging feature is nice but very cumbersome to deal with
2. Y-axis scaling is still very important, if possible it's an ID2 nice to have, but very important for ID3
  - Log scaling for the Y-axis would add value
3. We need to consider how to do Y-scaling for plain labels, so they don't get lost in amongst the data
  - We should consider showing different events at different heights
    - Perhaps these are clustered by some kind of common tag
4. Zooming is okay with the mouse wheel, but should be given some kind of functionality for those who don't have mice
5. BIG value bonus for porting this to something like Electron
  - This adds value because of issues with sensitive data
  - This could be more of an ID5 type issue
6. Uploading .csv files should be considered part of a minimally viable product for ID2

## In the short term these should be our priorities for ID3:

1. Displaying interval data
2. Displaying event data
3. Scrolling with keys
4. Y-axis/X-axis labeling
5. A visible legend
