DESCRIPTION

## Topics

[Group members can add topics if there is something to share/bring up/solve]

1. Braunson: Having an issue finding out how to do xyz
    - Have looked at the documentation for mycall() but it seems to do x when I want it to do Y
    - This open source project does x maybe we should do that?
2. Team: Decide which library to use to solve problem y
    - [Everyone can add points here]
    - [This library looks good!](http://random.cat)
    - [Maybe this one because it supports y?](http://random.dog)

    - And this works
    - This was an issue I had but I solved it
