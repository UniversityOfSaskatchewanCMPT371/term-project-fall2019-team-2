\section{Objectives}

A review of the design document was conducted remotely over
a video call. Preliminary document was read by all reviewers who
compiled their notes and shared them with the authors. The 
authors were able to answer all our questions and provide positive
feedback to defects raised. The design document was improved following
this review. The majority of the defects will be resolved for ID2 and
the rest will be filed on Github issues for later resolution.

\section{Scoring}
    Provide a rating from 1 - 5. \\
    1 - Work has room for improvement \\
    3 - Work was done to an acceptable standard \\
    5 - The work went above and beyond expectations\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
	\hline
	Criteria & Score\\
	\hline
    Completeness:
    (completed to the full scope of the requirements) & 4 \\
	\hline
    Concise:
    (the purpose is achieved without undue complication) & 5 \\
	\hline
    Structure/organization:
    (does the work flow, are components grouped logically?) & 4 \\
    \hline
    Grammar: & 4 \\
    \hline
\end{tabular}

\section{Notes}
    
\paragraph{What was done well?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The document preamble was well written and accurate
    \item The document was expansive, covering all methods and fields discussed in brainstorming sessions
    \item The document was written in "one voice"
    \item The design was clearly well planned and thought out for future expansion
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Other notes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Document is subject to change as the project develops
    \item The parser may be split up as more functionality is supported
    \item To enable further expansion of the logic core of our application (the parser) it maybe necessary to break the parser into an interface
\end{itemize}

\section{List of Defects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Table of contents would be nice to have
    \item The constructor types are missing for the Parser
    \item A visual diagram would help users understand the pipes and filter flow of data
    \item Lacking a description in removePredicate, the redraw being handled here may cause a cyclic dependency between the timeline and its filters.
    \item Predicates being stored as named strings could make it easier for users to remove or hide some of their filters
    \item Lack a method to get all predicates from a filter class
    \item Lack a method to toggle a filter
    \item Types should be well defined following typescript types where possible and more explicitly when required (ie, does a number type allow only integers or also floats?)
    \item UML should flow downwards starting from the parser
    \item UML has connections that are not described in the method types or fields in the class
    \item UML is missing fields that are described in the design document
\end{itemize}
