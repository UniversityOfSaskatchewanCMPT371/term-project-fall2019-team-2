Team Policy 

Attendance

Meetings and class room attendance is considered mandatory. 
If an individual cannot attend a meeting they are to notify the project lead (Amanda Zimolag) ahead of time and read the meeting minutes after. 
If more than three meetings are missed in the course of the term that person must talk to people?? IDK?

Ten minute meetings before class will be used as an informal stand up.
If a team 2 member cannot attend they are to post on slack what they have done since last time and what they plan to do for next time. 

All members will do daily check-ins of the repo and twice-weekly check-outs of the repo. 

We all commit to creating a safe work place where every opinion is valued and listened to.
