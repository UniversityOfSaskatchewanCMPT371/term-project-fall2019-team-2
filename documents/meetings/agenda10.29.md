# Meeting Agenda (OCTOBER 29th, 2019)

ID3 Meeting 1

## Topics

0. Stand-ups

1. Where are we?
  - How far along is development?
    - What features can we reasonably expect to have done by Friday?
  - How far along is testing?
    - What features can we reasonably expect to have tested by ID3 due-date?
  
2. Team Policy Update
  - policy for tardiness
  - policy for PR reviews
  - policy for responsiveness
  
3. What Branches Are people on?
  - Are we understanding GitFlow?
  - We need MORE PR's
  - We need less huge pushes
  - We can't create issues if we don't have work to look at, we're marked on issues usage so this will hurt us
  
4. No one seems to be using Trello
  - Dev team still only has 3 cards


## After Action Report (Minutes)

> Duration: 1 hour

1. Where are we?
  - We should have interval data, magnitude data, and point data implemented this deliverable
  - We need to look into a legend, scrolling with keys, and y-axis labeling still
  - Tests are expected to be implemented for all of these features by ID3 at the current pace
  - Eileen will make a manual testing template for the test team, so manual testing can be formalized with reports
  
2. Team Policy Updates
  - A policy for tardiness will be added
    - 10 minutes late is acceptable, any more and there should be a sufficent reason
    - Being repeatedly tardy may call for a yellow-card
  - A policy for PR reviews
    - People are expected to look at reviews once a day
    - If an item is not reviewed by a team member within 24 hours, any member can add themselves as a 
    reviewer and 'yoink' the review from you.  Although no formal action is taken, it reflects extremely
    badly on you if you're always letting your reviews get yoinked by more attentive teammates
  - A policy for responsiveness
    - A R&U (read and understood) response is mandatory in slack for messages, if you do not respond in slack
    with a :ladies_and_gentleman:, the PM (project manager) will PM (private message) you to ensure you've
    read the message and understand the implications
    
 3. Branches & GitFlow:
  - We agreed that more, smaller PR's will make life more managable
  - Last night (OCT 29TH) was the deadline for getting local branches merged and PR'd, anything not merged by
  that point is now considered incomplete

4. Trello usage
  - Mesa pointed out that the Dev Trello board actually has the tasks broken down into subtasks
  on the actual card itself.
  - It appears that people are actually using Trello
