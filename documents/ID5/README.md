## Builds

Builds in this deliverable only changed slightly to upload release source-maps to Sentry. Sentry
is now used to record errors and user feedback when an error occurs. The sourcemaps allow us to view
exactly what line in our code had the error.

For viewing our current code climate and test coverage, refer to sonarcloud [here](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=cmpt371-team2) which is updated on every push to the repository.
