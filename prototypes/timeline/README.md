# Timeline

Displays a simple timeline from a CSV.

## Objective

Initial spike/throwaway prototype to learn about react and related libraries.

## Results

What did we find out and how are we applying it?
Tested chart.js functionality to see if it will suit our needs for this project - it will not,
however, we may still be able to utilize chart.js for displaying auxiliary charts on the website.
